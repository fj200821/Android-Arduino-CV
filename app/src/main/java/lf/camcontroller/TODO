Objectives to be fulfilled under version family 2:

Base: The android phone would be attached to the robot. On receiving the start signal, the robot
tries to align such that it faces straight at the object. This is achieved using both the cameras.
Object would always be green in color.

2.1:
    1) The object would be placed in front of it.
    2) Start signal is given by a button on screen.

2.1.1:
    - Remove "When USB is connected, only then toggle button is enabled" functionality;
      Replace it such that, when "Start" is pressed, only then attached USBs are searched.
      Retain the ON DETACHED functionality as it is. Basically nothing happens USB is attached.
    - Remove the Start USB button and place it in the menu. Only log will be present below.

2.2:
    1) The object could be placed any where in range of sight of the robot. Need not be in front
    of it when the robot starts.

2.3:
    1) Addition of forward and backward functionalities.


PS: If time permits, and resources are proper, implement start and stop robot with headset.
    Else, the first priority is to complete the version 2 family.

    Complete all the programming with Arduino and then do the same with ATMega 8A.

NEXT: Line follower with IR sensors.
